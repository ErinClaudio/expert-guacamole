DESCRIPTION

A Python/Django project with a PostGIS extension and Leaflet
This Project has a database hosted in Heroku. 

HIGHLIGHTS

This project was one of the most challenging projects I completed up to that date.
Working with and finding an effective way to host a PostGIS extension was challenging. 
I ended up with multiple instances of the Postgres database locally. I was finally able to 'go-live' with this project after 
weeks of research and finally using homebrew to deep remove the local instances of Postgres then reinstalling.
